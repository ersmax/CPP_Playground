/*
What is the most important difference between a while statement and a
do-
while statement?
*/

// A `while` statement checks its condition before executing the loop body,
// meaning the body may not execute at all if the condition is false initially.
// In contrast, a `do-while` statement checks its condition after executing the loop body,
// ensuring that the body executes at least once regardless of the condition's initial value.
