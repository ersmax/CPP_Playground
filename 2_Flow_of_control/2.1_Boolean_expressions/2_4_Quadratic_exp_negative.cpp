/*
Consider the quadratic expression
x2 âˆ’ 4x + 3
Describing where this quadratic is negative involves describing a set of numbers
that are simultaneously greater than the smaller root (1) and less than the larger
root (3). Write a C++ Boolean expression that is true when the value of this
quadratic is negative.

/*
My answer:
x > 1 && x < 3
Parentheses are optional due to operator precedence:
The relational operators (`>`, `<`) have higher precedence than the logical AND operator (`&&`).
