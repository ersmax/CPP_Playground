/*
You sometimes see numeric intervals given as
2 < x < 3
In C++ this interval does not have the meaning you may expect. Explain
and give the correct C++ Boolean expression that specifies that x lies between 2
and 3.
*/

// My answer:

/*
In C++, the expression `2 < x < 3` is evaluated in two steps due to
operator precedence and associativity.
First, `2 < x` is evaluated, which results in a Boolean value (true or false).
Then, this Boolean value is compared to `3`, which is not the intended behavior.
In fact, either true (1) or false (0) will always be less than 3,
making the entire expression always true regardless of the value of `x`.
The correct way to express that `x` lies between `2` and `3` is to use
the logical AND operator (`&&`) to combine two comparisons: `2 < x && x < 3`.
