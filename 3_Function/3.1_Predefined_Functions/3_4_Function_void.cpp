/*
What is the function of the int argument to the void function exit?
*/
// The int argument to the void function exit represents the exit status code of the program.
// This status code is returned to the operating system or calling process when the program terminates.
// It indicates whether the program completed successfully or encountered an error during execution.
// A value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while a non-zero value indicates an error
// or abnormal termination. This status code can be used by the operating system or calling process
// to determine the outcome of the program's execution.
