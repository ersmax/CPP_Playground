/*
List the similarities and differences between how you invoke (call) a predefined
(that is, library) function and a user-defined function.
*/
/*
Answer:
   Similarities:
   1. Both predefined and user-defined functions are invoked using their names followed by parentheses.
   2. Both types of functions can take arguments (parameters) within the parentheses.
   3. Both can return values that can be used in expressions or assigned to variables.
   4. Both can be used to modularize code and improve readability.
   Differences:
   1. Predefined functions are part of the standard library and are readily available for use,
      while user-defined functions must be explicitly defined by the programmer before they can be called.
   2. Predefined functions often have specific names and behaviors defined by the library,
      while user-defined functions can have any valid name and behavior as defined by the programmer.
   3. Predefined functions may have specific requirements for argument types and numbers,
      while user-defined functions can be designed to accept a wide range of argument types and numbers
      based on the programmer's needs.
   4. Predefined functions are typically optimized for performance and reliability,
      while user-defined functions may vary in efficiency and reliability depending on the implementation.
   5. Predefined functions are documented in the library documentation, while user-defined functions require
      the programmer to provide documentation for their usage and behavior.
   6. User-defined functions must be declared or defined before they are used,
      while libraries must be included at the beginning of the program to access predefined functions.
